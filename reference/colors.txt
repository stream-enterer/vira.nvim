The colors file follows the standard Plasma color scheme file format and allows a theme to define what colors work best with its theme elements. The colors in this file can be edited with the color scheme editor available in System Settings.

Make a new color scheme using the editor in System Settings -> Appearance -> Colors.
Save it with a unique name.
You will see the new color scheme in ~/.local/share/color-schemes/[theme-name].colors.
Copy everything to your Plasma Style colors file except the [ColorEffects:Disabled] and [ColorEffects:Inactive] sections.
The most common use of the colors file is to ensure that text is readable on various backgrounds.

Here is a non-comprehensive list of the main color entries in the colors file that are currently actively used in a Plasma Style:

[Colors:Window]

ForegroundNormal: the text color applied to text on the standard background elements; maps to Theme::TextColor
BackgroundNormal: the default background color used for items that paint a background themselves, allowing them to blend in with the theme; maps to Theme::BackgroundColor
DecorationHover: the color used for text highlighting; maps to Theme::HighlightColor
[Colors:Button]

ForegroundNormal: the text color to use on push buttons
ForegroundActive: the color used to tint BackgroundNormal for final button hinting color
BackgroundNormal: the background color used for hinting buttons
[Colors:View]

ForegroundLink: the text color used for clickable links
ForegroundVisited: the text color used for visited links
ForegroundNormal: the text color used most non-title text in applications
ForegroundInactive: the text color used for secondary text, like placeholders in text fields ("Search…")

BackgroundNormal: the color used for the background of tooltips
Other colors in the file may be used by individual widgets or used in the future, so you are encouraged to provide a complete color scheme file.

The following colors are currently also used by individual plasmoids, which should give a good idea of additional usage patterns:

[Colors:View]

BackgroundNormal: used as a background color for the digital clock and the dictionary plasmoid search field.
ForegroundNormal: used by the digital clock for most of its minute indicators and arrows, as well as the text color used in the search field of the dictionary plasmoid.
DecorationFocus: used to outline the dictionary plasmoid search field.
DecorationHover: used when hovering the dictionary plasmoid search field.
[Colors:Complementary]

Same roles as Colors:Window, those are used in areas such as the logout screen, the screen locker, and other areas in order for them to have independent colors compared to normal plasmoids.
Note that some of these may end up folded back into Plasma::Theme properly at some point.
