Detailed Description
Plasma::Theme provides access to a common and standardized set of graphic elements stored in SVG format. This allows artists to create single packages of SVGs that will affect the look and feel of all workspace components.

Plasma::Theme can also be used directly to retrieve file system paths to SVGs by name.
